CDX is a remake of the old DXAG mod for DXMP, allowing for new features and more map potential.

Place the cTeleporter objects, found under Triggers in the Editor, in any map, set up the properties to any of the default classes, or set a custom class, and place the cMut mutator object, and any map is ready to go.

## Current mod progress
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Squash more bugs
- [ ] More maps
