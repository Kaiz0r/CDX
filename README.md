## Welcome to CDX

CDX is a remake of he old DXAG mod for DXMP, allowing for new features and more map potential.

Places the cTeleporter objects under Triggers in any map, set up the properties to any of the default classes, or set a custom class, and place the cMut mutator object, and any map is ready to go.
